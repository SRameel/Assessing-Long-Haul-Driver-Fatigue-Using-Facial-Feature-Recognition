# Assessing-Long-Haul-Driver-Fatigue-Using-Facial-Feature-Recognition 
Driver Fatigue Detection System

Introduction:
In the vast realm of the transportation industry, long-haul drivers are pivotal, ensuring that goods traverse vast distances. However, the extended nature of their work often leads to fatigue, a significant contributor to highway accidents. Understanding the profound impact of fatigue on a driver's reaction time, decision-making, and overall performance, this project was initiated to develop a system that detects and monitors driver fatigue, aiming to bolster road safety.

Project Overview:
This project revolves around the design and implementation of a system that detects and monitors driver fatigue by meticulously analyzing facial features.

Key Features:

Facial Feature Monitoring: The system is adept at continuously observing and pinpointing changes in facial features that are indicative of driving fatigue.
Fatigue Profile Creation: A unique feature allows the creation and maintenance of a profile for each user, encapsulating their fatigue patterns and thresholds.
Intuitive User Interface: A user-friendly stand-alone GUI has been crafted, which promptly alerts the driver upon detecting signs of fatigue and advises taking a break.
Methodology:

**Literature & Market Survey**: A comprehensive exploration was conducted into existing techniques and products that utilize facial biometrics for fatigue recognition.
**Hardware Selection**: The best-suited hardware for collecting video data was identified and procured.
**Data Collection**: Video data, focusing on various facial expressions and fatigue indicators, was systematically gathered and labeled.
**Algorithm Development**: Algorithms were meticulously designed and implemented for face detection and the extraction of pertinent facial features.
**Profile Training**: The system is equipped to train, test, and validate a fatigue profile tailored to individual users.
**Visualization Mechanism**: A feature was developed to visually represent facial detection, the extracted facial features, and the corresponding alert systems.
